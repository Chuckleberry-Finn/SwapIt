title=Swap It
description=[b]Does the following:[/b]
description=[list]
description=[*]Equipped weapons will swap places with hotslotted weapons instead of being put away entirely.
description=[*] Example: If you have Weapon A on your belt and Weapon B in hand- selecting weapon A will equip weapon A and put weapon B on your belt.
description=[*]Activating an empty hotslot will attach the equipped item if possible.
description=[*]Individual hotslots can be toggled via options menu.
